 * Description: Uses the OpenCV library to provide @native two
 * procedures for RVC-CAL programs compiled with Orcc. The first is
 * `source_camera_init` is passed the width and height of the
 * resolution of the source camera. It must be called before
 * `readCameraFrame` which captures one complete frame from the source
 * camera and writes to three arrays for R G and B respectively, which
 * can then be used by the calling RVC-CAL actor.
 *
 * The `main` function below can be uncommented to compile and test
 * this file in isolation.
